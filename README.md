As a software engineer, I developed a mobile game called HappyTire using Unity, during a game jam of 72 hours hosted by FF Studios with the sponsorship of Universidad de Concepci√≥n and Huawei. This game was made with the collaboration of a team of 4 people, where the theme is KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and the game's objective is to destroy as many obstacles as possible and win points.
